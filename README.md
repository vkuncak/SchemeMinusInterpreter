In particular, after installing Visual Studio Code (vscode) and sbt,
open a terminal in the directory where this README.md file is,
and run:

  sbt launchIDE

This should start vscode. Once in vscode, open the .sc (worksheet)
files in the directory

  src/main/scala

and in particular, file

  Main.sc 

Be patient with the IDE initially; it works in the background
to start up the evaluation of the worksheet. Once warmed up,
it should become responsive.
